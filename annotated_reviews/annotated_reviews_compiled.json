Not only do you get pretty large portions, but the food is divine. The chicken tenders, the bread, the coleslaw...and the sauce. Everything perfectly compliments everything else on the plate. There is no one item that is not made into perfection. After you finish that delicious, greasy meal, you can wash it down with some nice sweet iced tea. This will definitely revive you after your crazy Vegas trip. \n\nThe one thing that I had a bit of trouble with was the price of the sauce. They give you a certain amount of sauce per order...but once you try the sauce, you know why you'll need more. I seriously drench everything in that sauce. But if you want more, they're going to charge you. Unfortunate, but understandable. \n\ntl;dr - I would drive to Vegas just to get Raising Cane's...that's how good it is."}

Wicked Spoon was so awesome. Good food, beautiful restaurant, great service! Doesn't get much better than that. It seems like every detail was meticulously planned out, right down to the BEAUTIFUL placemats. I loved those so much that I wanted to take them home... Presentation really makes this place. Even the water bottles were very classy and Parisian. \n\nWicked Spoon is a bit cheaper than the Bellagio Buffet by a few bucks, but they generally come out to be the same price. It's so easy to make your money's worth with the Prime Rib and Mashed Potatoes. I swear I could come here and eat just those two things all day! Some of the other foods looked amazing, but they didn't quite tickle my palette. A significant amount of the food items offered were on the salty side. My advice: pass on the Veal Burger, Tostadas, Green Curry Noodles, and Pasta, but eat lots and lots of Prime Rib, Mashed Potatoes, Angry Mac and Cheese, and anything in the desserts section! I usually don't eat desserts at buffets because I feel like it's a waste of prime real estate in my tummy, but Wicked Spoon's dessert selection is too classy to resist. After all, they have their own Gelato station!! The Mint Gelato is to die for with their wafer pearls. So cute and satisfying!\n\nComing here, I felt like my boyfriend and I had the smallest table ever, so I was worried there wouldn't be enough room for all of my plates. Once I came back after getting more food though, I realized our table had already been cleared of our previous plates. Awesome and unbeatable service at a buffet!\n\nIf you're deciding between the Bellagio Buffet and Wicked Spoon, go with the Bellagio if you want more variety since the Bellagio has a huge selection of good food all around. Some of the items at Wicked Spoon are a hit or miss, so I'd say Wicked Spoon is better for those with a smaller palette or those who want a fancier dining experience."}

We actually got to see the game from our table. Yes, we think we got the best seat in the house. Early birds do catch the worm.\n\nThe same person who waited on us last time was one of the three that night. They were all professional and knowledgeable. I always look for, not just manners and confidence, but intellect. Outstanding hall staff know when to interrupt and even make out what you murmur even if it's not clear - and get it right! At least two of the three were super last Saturday night. They recommended the tuna/crab/filet trio for appetizer, which was great, and always had my champagne glass full. But they never came over when we didn't need them after my wife told them that it was our anniversary.\n\nAnd the food - We had the tuna/crab/filet trio for starter, bourbon filet and shrimp for entree, and got the creme brulee on the house. All amazing. Even my wife, who's not a big steak fan, was awed by my bourbon filet mignon. Her shrimp was great as well. We also ordered a bottle of Moet Chandon after our cocktails were done. We loved it.\n\nI'm sure there are many more foodies and Yelp elites who have experience more restaurants in Charlotte than me; and I do not doubt that some will disagree. But I really vote for Bentley's as the best fine dining restaurant here in Charlotte after going around for 3 years now. It could be my preference. I do like places with a great view, excellent food, and it can't be too loud. The famous steakhouses here are mostly on the first floor, the other one on top of another building is too loud.

Some guy who is friends with the owner grabbed my boyfriend's arm and said \"Excuse me!\" and my boyfriend looks at him and says \"You're excused.\" So the guy points at the beefy security guards to throw my boyfriend out of the door for being a \"smartass.\"  You don't throw people out for that, especially when he didn't start the whole thing.  You kick people out for being drunk and disorderly, which my boyfriend was neither.  When he tried to come back to get me, that is when one of the bouncers pushed him so hard he almost fell over.

The trick is for those of us well past our college days is to come when the students are still in bed nursing their hangovers or at midday while they are stuck in class learning things which they'll almost never use.  At these times of day you practically have the restaurant to yourself.   \n\nAs for the restaurant itself, the decor is modern and very spacious. So no jammed packed table seating here.  The wait staff is nice and somewhat tentative.   \n\nI've been to Mongolian type restaurants before so for the most part I knew what to expect.  When seated you will note a pad of paper which is where you select the type of rice you want, an option between egg or bread and if you want the option to have your meal served as a soup.  The wait staff will also provide you with two bowls, a large one for veggies and a smaller one for meats.   Don't worry, you can pile a good amount of meat in the bowl they provide.   \n\nOnce you've made your selection on the pad of paper, tear it off and head over to the veggie counter and start loading up your bowl.   Don't be shy, it's okay to have a heaping mound.   Then circle around the corner and select your sauces/spices.  \n\nIt is hear that experience does help out.  When you think you have added enough sauces, then add twice as much more, although be careful with the spicy ones as the spicy heat can flash up a few notches when cooked.   The veggie bowl is bigger not so much so it can hold more veggies, but so you can get the right amount of liquid which will help keep everything from drying out... especially the meat.   I would suggest you spoon in one or two of the thicker sauces (such has the chili paste), then spoon in one or two liquid sauces (such as soy) and then around three spoons of the flavored water (such as the garlic water).   Then proceed to loading up your meat bowl.  At the end of the counter you'll find a few spices, add on what you will, and don't be sparingly about it, as these are in powder form.  Most of it will burn off in the high heat.    \n\nAt the end of the counter is a large flat surface.  This is where you leave your bowl and most importantly that little piece of paper you written on as that gives the cook last minute instructions when he sets up your meal on the large cooking surface.   Not to mention it also has your table number on it so they know where to deliver the final product.  \n\nOnce you set down your bowl you can either watch the cook in action or go back to your seat.    \n\nOverall, my experience here was really good.  The bowl came to the table with the food well blended and hot.  It tasted really good, was not dry, burnt or underdone.  (mind you, I add a lot of the liquid sauces and flavored water... it does not come out soupy)  Their quality of food is really good and I must say, I enjoyed the boc-choy and water-chestnuts.  I'll certainly come back here again !"}

I mean, I did get a decent meal and by all means recommend it if you can afford it. But for the amount of money I dropped on this meal - more than I've ever spent on any meal in my entire life - I expected nothing short of perfection. What I got was just...good.\n\nTo start, the service was weak and unprofessional. Our waitress did not approach our table until fifteen minutes after we were seated, and she didn't appear to be very talented at her job. That is, she could be a little too talkative at times and yet she made herself very difficult to find when she was needed. She by no means was the worst waitress I've had, but this clearly isn't your stereotypical \"snooty Frenchman waiting on you hand and foot\" experience. I would figure a place like this can afford to hire the cream of the crop in service staff.\n\nAnd the food was really good! But it wasn't great. My main course (scallops) was alright, but not worth the triple cost I paid for them when compared against many seafood restaurants. Same goes for my girlfriend's pumpkin and squash dishes.\n\nI really, truly enjoyed the (not French) onion soup and that has to be the most memorable experience for me at this restaurant. It takes a lot of talent to bring a soup up to that kind of silky consistency and it was so absolutely packed with flavor that I had to work at in very small sips. I also appreciated the chef constantly sending out amuse-boches to keep us happy between courses.\n\nIf there's a carpaccio plate on the menu when you choose to come here, don't pass it up. I don't think you could find anywhere else in town that could prepare the dish with such skill and originality. I ordered a paper-thin bison carpaccio with onion crisps and a salad on top that combined to make a flavor that was just out of this world.\n\nDessert? I don't even remember it. The one cocktail we bought was too overpowering to taste like much other than whiskey.\n\nOverall, due to the restrictive cost this place is only for very special occasions. But for the price I'm paying I expect way more than a series of hit-or-misses and I'd be much better off spending this kind of money in a place like Chicago. L'Etoile's got very few competitors in the gourmet restaurant game in Madison and it really does show."}

Just be aware that all of them are money-grubbing hos. In the end, they are just putting up an act to get as much out of you as possible.  Have fun, but don't be a dumb ass!"}

The weekend brunch is decidedly solid, especially given their awesome breakfast potatoes.  My husband and I would most often share the scramble du jour and the special breakfast sandwich-consistently rotating and consistently good.  I especially liked the specials featuring pulled pork.  I only ate dinner here once, but the pulled pork burrito I had that night was delicious.  \n\nI would be remiss not to mention the best feature of brunch: the rocking Bloody Mary with a beer back.  The Bloody Mary is hearty and spicy, and the beer helps to neutralize the bite and provides a clean finish.  The pairing is so natural and the Bloody so good that Bloody Mary's at other establishments suffer by comparison.  Don't try it unless you're ready to set a new bar for Bloody Mary consumption (and spend the afternoon in a blissful state of buzzed slumber)."}

Staff is very friendly and attentive. I can order my fish grilled instead of fried for my fish tacos. Not on the menu but the waitress offered. I always order double beans instead of rice, no problem. Street tacos are yummy. Beer is cold and they have Modelo Negra, my favorite. Their breakfast burritos are large enough for my breakfast and lunch! Again, they will customize. I don't like potatoes in my chorizo egg  burrito so they make it without for me. Still a huge, spicy cheesy indulgence. Be sure to have the green salsa. Tomatillo? They won't give me the recipe, lol! Good, not gourmet, food at reasonable prices and with friendly staff."}

They really do FRESH food well.   The house salad uses local farm lettuce and the ranch dressing is homemade.  Sooooo, much flavor.  I really like the jicama, cucumber, onion salad that was on top of the lettuce, too.   My kids LOVED the White truffle mac and cheese.. it was rich and flavorful.   The chorizo sliders were served on a great bun with a tasty little side salad.   We decided to try the crepe.  SOOOOOOO, good.  The orange butter sauce was so yummy.....I wanted a bowl of it.  The ice cream was the amazing Vanilla from Sweet Republic.   We cannot wait to go back.  The burger and pork belly will be tried next time....they smelled amazing.   The staff and owner were really friendly, too.   I wish them lots of success."}

It has spectacular views of the valley and has the food to back up the view. \n\nWe arrived for a late lunch. The dining area isn't the biggest but was quite comfortable and the noise level was acceptable. The food was very good. I highly recommend the roasted brussel sprouts small plate. I know, I know... Brussel Sprouts? Really, they were amazing. Oven roasted with a hint of sweetness, shaved garlic and a sprinkling of (I think) goat cheese. Fabulous flavor. \n\nSince the sandwiches are kind of large we split an avocado BLT. Tasty but messy. Exceptional bacon though. As others have stated, the thin cut French fries were excellent. Splitting the sprouts and the sandwich between two people made for a great lunch. Add a glass of prosecco and you have a fine meal."}

Pretty much all of the other music venues I wanted to visit reserve their acts for Friday and Saturday nights (especially on a holiday weekend like Thanksgiving). However, I'm more of a middle-of-the-week music appreciator. For other Monday night music lovers, this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues. \n\nI used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played, in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times, at a little club called Small's in Manhattan's West Village. And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly, Country, and Blues musicians around (for FREE!) at Rodeo Bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill any night of the week, has also spoiled me.\n\nMy point being - places like Small's, Rodeo Bar, and Double Door Inn are a dying breed. It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal, and velvet-rope-free. Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a \"school night\", if you bring a group of friends here now, it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come."}

There were only two people working during peak hour. One couldn't get the smoothies straight. The other greeted what seemed to be an out of uniform employee who asked him to get something from the back. In the middle of a packed store with 8 people each waiting for multiple smoothies, the guy stopped making smoothies, went to the back, came back with some papers and proceeded to chat it up with his friend. Slow as snails. No sense of urgency what so ever. Customers come first. The guy's friend should have waited for things to die down before he received what he needed. This place needs to get it together! You clearly have the traffic so get some more competent employees. Smoothie making is not that difficult!\n\nOn a side note, it felt like there was no A/c running which is dangerous for customers and employees."}

It was already kind of late and it was a Sunday..and so it wasn't crowded. The inside area was nice...it wasn't anything amazing but it was kinda cool. It had a very relaxed atmosphere compared to that of other places. The outside area was the best part. The view was SOOOO gorgeous. It was really windy though...not good the hair but still awesome! Ghost bar was probably the only place where the people would actually have conversations with you with out saying something totally disgusting and rude. The music wasn't that great but there really weren't many people dancing anyway. I really liked how there were tables and chairs that didn't require bottle service. A girl really needs to sit after three hours in heels! Oh also the little piece of glass floor was so amusing. Ghost bar was a great place if you want to just hang out and enjoy a view...but probably not if you want to \"get crazy\" and dance."}

I'm having a hard time reconciling some of the reviews with the experience we had.\n\nWe found the service engaging, friendly, and appropriately paced. We were neither ignored nor rushed. Viviana, our server, was excellent in every respect.\n\nThe chairs were comfortable, the music - custom mixed by a friend of the owner, we were told - was eclectic and intelligent - we had to stop and SoundHound it a few times, as there were tracks we wanted to download for ourselves. The place was not busy when we were there, so I can't speak to noise control, but when we were there, it was easy to carry on a conversation.\n\nI started with a wonderful white cheddar and cauliflower soup. One of us had the Puds, and enjoyed it thoroughly. My entree was the Bangers & Mash, served with a rich, thick sauce with caramelized onions - perfect with a nice, cold Belhaven Scotch Ale.\n\nA whole dessert would have been too much - so I shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and it was flawless, with a caramel which reminded me of childhood desserts - far removed from the prepared caramel glop which you find in so many restaurants. The other dessert at the table was the Ice Cream Cake, which was so good that the person ordering it wasn't the least bit interested in sharing~~~\n\nThe next time I'm in LV, this will be on my list for a repeat."}
